Then me and my daughter ate some. We both looked at each other with an odd look. Ok, maybe the first bite is a little off.

Packed exclusively for American Roland food Corp.  New York, NY 10010.  Product of China<br /><br />Peaches, water, and sugar can't possibly taste this nasty!  The texture of the liquid has an unusual viscosity to it for light syrup. This produces an odd mouth feel after the second bite, can't exactly explain it.

It's super hot and at first all you may get out of it is hot, but if you're in it for pure heat then go with the 3am special reserve from blair (basically pure, slightly diluted capsaicin). However, this powder has a great flavor of its own as well as acting like MSG by exciting all the other flavors in your food - so power through the first few applications, let your system get used to it, then everything tastes way better because of it.  I use it on everything except sweets.  People will be insulted when you want to sprinkle on their homemade dish because they don't understand that it's not like normal hotsauce; just tell them that it's exactly like their salt and pepper but more-so.<br /><br />The best part is no matter how much hot you are used to, you can achieve a superior sharp burn without the acid reflux side-effects of super-hotsauce (pure capsaicin actually counteracts acid reflux and ulcer problems fyi) or the intestinal problems associated with non-extracted habanero or ghost chili powder.  Or you can just get some heat and flavor - whatever you're in the mood for, Nitro will abide.  Additionally, it's much harder to get hot-eyes with Nitro than with super-hotsauces because it's a powder and doesn't stay on your hands.<br /><br />non-chiliheads: I suggest you go with Blair's Death Rain Habanero - great flavor without as much heat (still hot though, it's about 1/4th as hot as Nitro by weight).<br /><br />caution: do not fry</td></tr><tr><td>253848</td><td>B001UO90BA</td><td>A2GLFUXWD0EHW6</td><td>Laura</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>1334275200</td><td>!!Fast Delivery, excellent mate!!!!, thank you!!!!</td><td>\"<a href=\"\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UO90BA\"\">Yerba Mate Cruz de Malta x 500 g Argentina Diet Loss Herbal Bags Slim 1.1 lb New</a><br /><br />Excellent Yerba Mate</td></tr><tr><td>244531</td><td>B00389TID0</td><td>A38VQEYO0AUJ69</td><td>kathy c</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>1346284800</td><td>!LOVE THESE!</td><td>I LOVE these!

Blah, Blah, Blah. Well I eventually got it right. I remember my first Capuchino in Italy...Maybe you have been there before???? It tasted like they put chocolate in it???? Of course it did not have chocolate in it but it tasted almost like Hot Cocoa at least to me. In retro spect to my home brew I went thru half a bag of beans to get it right but I did and it was the first time in the States I ever tasted Capuchino that had that chocolate type flavor.<br /><br />Now today I received a box of this stuff(three huge bags) so my journey begins.... This coffee is a medium roast(brown in color) and the Beans look very fresh... Also what the name implies is that you will get Crema. That is completely true. You will get a Crema even if you do not know what you are doing. Why is that???? Well probably because the roast is lighter and not very oily???<br /><br />As far as flavor goes? Everyone has their own taste.. I like certain things like hot spicy food etc. some people do not, so I hate to judge flavor according to my taste Buds. So what am I trying to say???? Obviously I do not like it but that does not mean that you won't. The quality of the Beans look great but I feel that the taste is Bitter and not because I over heated my Machine. I still have a very undesirable taste in my Mouth.<br /><br />Bottom Line.... If you want that Chocolate type Flavor??? I doubt that you will ever get it from this Roast.... Yes you will get Crema and I am not pushing the other brand that I mentioned but I think you have to go with a Fresh Dark Roast... Even when I was playing with my new toy and did not get a good crema the coffee still had that great flavor.... So as far as I am concerned... They should name this Coffee.. \"\" Crema for Idiots\"\"  So do not order Three large Bags of this Stuff. Controll your impulse. Order one bag at a time of different types until you find what you like. Now I have Three Bags of this Coffee!!!!! Not sure what too do with it??? Not sure if not liking it is cause to return a product????<br /><br />Anyway hope this helps\"</td></tr><tr><td>380732</td><td>B000NLA51A</td><td>A2A1XYSB692L6J</td><td>\"Patricia \"\"A Reader\"\"\"</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1269388800</td><td>\"\"\" D E B U T A N T E \"\"......C O F F E E\"</td><td>\"\"\"Jamacian Mountain Peak\"\" Instant coffee has won a \"\"Monde Selection\"\" award</td></tr><tr><td>406255</td><td>B000H223O2</td><td>A2XUJG39VAZ7C8</td><td>Theresa R.

These have a very soft, pleasant taste that grows on you.  One of these shortly before bedtime makes me feel calm, relaxed and quite self-indulgent, although they're actually more nutritious than you might think.  A very desirable item to stock in the pantry for last-minute entertaining, or to bring along when visiting a sick friend or a shut-in.  They're actually good for settling a shaky stomach (must be the ginger and/or cinnamon?!), which may be one reason Delta gives them out as in-flight snacks.  They're fabulous with a dish of ice cream or fresh fruit, or with port,  brandy, cream sherry or a liqueur after dinner.  They work well as an item for elegant receptions.  We like to offer them at dinner parties along with coffee and dessert.  Unlike many cookies, they go as well with morning, afternoon or evening tea as with coffee, and of course they're marvelous on their own.  I just ordered 2 packs of 5 and will be ordering more before those are gone.  Hooray!

My only negative comment is that the starting Specific Gravity is low therefore these are lower alcohol wines. I did add a couple cups of sugar to the fermenter at the beginning...but worried that adding too much sugar would throw off the flavor of the wine. Anyway, the Pear Chablis is a nice easy drinking wine. It has an attractive label. I used clear bottles and the final product looks sharp.<br />If you are looking for straight wines that are not sweet fruit flavored wines, check out the Vino Italiano kits. These also come with corks, foils, and labels.

Spring water must be collected at the spring or through a borehole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring. Evian and Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water.<br /><br />Artesian water is obtained from a well that taps a confined aquifer, an underground layer of rock or sand that contains water. Fiji Natural Artesian Water is one example of artesian water source.<br /><br />Distilled water is water that has been boiled and then recondensed from the steam that the boiling produces. The process of distillation kills microbes and removes minerals, however it tends to give it a flat taste.

My dismay is not with the crackers but with the packaging.  I order multiple boxes from Amazon every few weeks.  When I open them a good half or more are cracker crumbs, no longer crackers.  That makes for a pretty expensive cracker.  When the company is smart enough to come up with a good gluten free cracker then surely they can devise a way of packaging it so it arrives in one piece. i know they are fragile but that is not a good excuse.

I'm glad I didn't buy the whole package. If you like richer hot chocolates, then you will not like this. I tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings (smaller, medium, larger cups on the three option Keurig machines). All of the options tasted too watery for me. I would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them.  If this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee, it is, like the stars-rating claims, okay.

They are moist with a deja vu hint of Tortuga rum-The original is the best in my assessment.<br />2. The cakes are packaged nicely to avoid damage in transit and sealed well to lock in moisture.<br />3. They taste good and are well balanced, pairing nicely with ice cream.<br />4. These are basically presented as rum-flavored Bundt cakes-fluted and sectioned for slicing.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. These cakes are extremely over-priced. For the price, you could not only prepare a far better and higher quality cake but also afford to lace it with a generous bath of rum.<br />2. Conventional ingredients-bleached white flour, aluminum, partially hydrogenated oils, preservatives and artificial food colorings and dyes.  This is apparent when you slice into the cake and need to grab your sunglasses from the bright yellow color of the cake-that's yellow dye folks...not gold rum! I can assure you...There's no gold in dem 'dere mills!<br />3. The walnuts on top of the cake are sparse.<br />4. You will need an electron microscope to measure the amount of rum in this cake.<br />5. The cake is very one-dimensional and could use a good rum icing to complement the flavor and complete this treat.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  If you have the time, make your own for the best rum cake available.<br />  If all you make are reservations, then get the cake and ask Marie Antoinette to pay for it!</td></tr><tr><td>264998</td><td>B005CIMZAS</td><td>A25TATUT0AGUJ7</td><td>Deb Swan</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>1282780800</td><td>\"\"\"Lightly sweet\"\"???\"</td><td>\"What an aggravating product.

Many tea lovers like a strong, black tea, and I, too, enjoy these. But sometimes you want something that's not so powerful, perhaps after you've already had a number of cups, or perhaps late in the afternoon or in the evening. This Twinings blend fits the bill perfectly. It is smooth, almost silky to the taste, with a mild black tea flavor that also has a hint of aroma. It's really a welcome addition to any tea-lover's tea set, and when you also consider the more than reasonable price, it's easily a home run.<br /><br />Like most Twinings teas, the bags are individually wrapped to keep freshness using a sealed, moisture resistant paper.

Get some. It tastes like bacon.  I'm glad I am not a Muslim because they probably can't eat this stuff.  That is a good thing.  That leaves more for me.  Ha ha.  I have this set up on the automatic order system through Amazon.com  That makes the price a dollar or two cheaper.  It also makes it convenient for me so that I can keep my canned goods rotating.  Instead of ordering or purchasing large quantities that all have the same expiration date on them I will keep getting new stock with fresh dates on them.  I have my system set up for every two months so I will get 6 fresh cans at a time.  This is just one of the ways that I am staying prepared for emergencies.  Don't get caught with your pantry empty.  History could repeat itself so do some little things to help make sure that you will have a little food stored for the unexpected.<br />By the way I slice this up and fry it in the skillet.  It really does smell and taste like bacon.<br />I think I bought some at Sam's Club once but when I went back for more they did not have it.<br />Wal-Mart didn't have it either.<br />What I do is open the can and extract the meat from inside carefully.  I make at least 8 equal slices.  Thinner is better but I find that I like uniformity in my slice.  I spray the skillet lightly with some non stick spray.  Turn the burner on high and wait a minute or two for it to get hot. Place the slices in the pan for 4 or 5 minutes and turn the heat back to medium high.  Flip them over and brown both side.  If either side isn't uniformly brown flip again until it is just right.<br />Cooking them this way will reduce the fat content a little.  It adds a lightly crisp texture and a cooked meat flavor.  I like to eat them just like that out of the pan.  I also like to put two slices between bread with a little mustard.</td></tr><tr><td>304973</td><td>B006J4MAUE</td><td>A3SYE6NEO8VSU0</td><td>Silver Stars</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1333152000</td><td>\"\"\"Scrumptious\"\"\"</td><td>Nature's Path Love Crunch, Premium Organic Granola, with dark chocolate and red berries is both healthy and nutritious.

Absurdly delicious, this wonderful food is distinctly different from other coconut products and a delightful substitute for butter and/or cream.<br /><br />Made from the entire edible portion of the coconut and not just the oil, coconut manna naturally contains beneficial fiber, minerals, and essential fatty acids. Creamy in texture with just a touch of natural sweetness, it works as a spread on toast and is heavenly mixed with oatmeal. As noted in other reviews, the manna solidifies at room temperature and needs to be softened and mixed before using. If you skip this step, you will end up with the oil separating to the top of the jar and the more fibrous part collecting in the middle. Not exactly a bad thing per se, but it is better completely mixed.<br /><br />The only downside to coconut manna is the high amount of saturated fat. The saturated fat in coconut has a strange structure: the fatty acids are medium chain, instead of long or short chain. What this means in practical terms is that your body has to heat up to burn off the medium chain triglycerides (or MCTs), leading some to claim weight loss benefits. The science on this so far is mixed, but too much saturated fat is never a great thing for anybody. So, everything in moderation, and no eating the whole jar in one sitting.

The meal was satisfying, or at least wasn't directly and immediately awful, and my boys gleefully gobbled the stuff up, but I already have plans to make a more natural follow-up to this meal, with a homemade cheese sauce, and I figure it'll cost about the same as this box, be a whole lot healthier, and take only a few minutes more of my time so long as I'm making the sauce and the meal at the same time.</td></tr><tr><td>289254</td><td>B001E52WNS</td><td>A393SW83L4WH3G</td><td>\"mcHaiku \"\"nmi\"\"\"</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1213142400</td><td>\"\"\"YEP!

We have used it on pork and chicken and it tastes pretty good on those too. For one cook-out he used this seasoning and I made little gift pouches.

The instructions on how to use it were in the bottom of the bag, which didn't halp until I'd already used most of it.<br /><br />4.  The litter tracks much worse than World's Greatest, since the clumps are harder, they stick between paws easier, and are transported to all areas of the house.<br /><br />5.  The litter is harder, so when you step on a tiny clump with bare feet, it hurts more.  Only thing more painful is Litter Pearls.<br /><br />So overall, I am not impressed.

Sometimes meter readers or other repairmen might leave the gate open, and just in case they did, the above ground fence was extra security.<br /><br />There is a downside to it.  It's not very attractive, and depending on how you lay it out, you might have to constantly step over the two wires yourself.<br /><br />I don't think anyone should rely on this as their only way of keeping a pet enclosed, but it does provide a good back up system.  I started using mine when my dog was still a puppy.  Unlike wireless systems, where the dog must wear a special collar and must be put through a training process, virutally no training is required here.  The first time the dog comes in contact with the wire, he or she will get shocked and won't go near it again.  My dog never even considers jumping over it, even though he easily could.<br /><br />There are some other drawbacks.  The very thin aluminum wires tend to break over time, and if the ground wire breaks off, the light will continue to blink, but the fence will not produce a shock.  I recommend you buy a spool of additional aluminum wire because you will need to replace the wire over time.<br /><br />By the way, the \"\"shock\"\" is not all that mild!

Well, since I feed my dogs raw, I knew the only source of grain they really got was the dog biscuits, so I then switched to Costco-brand chicken jerky strips, but when my one dogs soon seemed lethargic and not like his usual self, and I took him to the vet for a blood draw, I found his liver enzymes were very high! After a month of serious perplexion, I was brought to wonder if now the chicken jerky strips were the culprit, and sure enough, there were DOZENS of postings on Google about those chicken jerky-type treats (from China) being discovered to have melamine coating, and causing fatalities and grave liver illnesses in dogs!

I do prefer other brands of espresso, but Illy's consistency is great since it is to be found in many restaurants around the globe.<br /><br />So it is with some sadness that I write a negative review. First off - please note that this is actually a coffee flavored energy beverage made and packaged by Coca Cola. Illy has partnered in order to take proceeds by allowing their name to be used. There might be a some of their coffee used, but it would be processed coffee extract, and so there wouldn't be much reason to use expensive Arabica coffee when extract from lower quality Robusto would work.<br /><br />This canned beverage seems to taste pleasant enough at first, but then it starts to turn metallic. The coffee flavor really is a 'coffee flavor'. There is just something artificial and chemical tasting about this drink. Granted, it's only 45 calories, most coming from the beet extract sweetener.  And don't be fooled by beet sweetener, it's really no different than any other unbleached sugar.  It is regularly used to Chaptalize wine in fact.  Don't be lured in by the low calorie claim: fresh brewed iced coffee without sweetener? Zero calories. Yes. Zero. (okay, actually 0.01 calories! sorry!) So it's not like they're really doing anything crazy by offering this at 45 calories.  It's just less sugar added than the super sweet beverages.  Really it seems the sweetener was added to try and mask the artificial and metallic flavor.<br /><br />There are better iced coffees on the market.  I hope we really start to see some more variety and availability soon.  Other countries like Japan have a huge market for bottled and canned unsweetened tea and coffee, so hopefully we can get on the bandwagon soon.  Hopefully with better tasting results.</td></tr><tr><td>480017</td><td>B003IHO8OG</td><td>AW6ECFKXLXDXD</td><td>SoniCool7</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>1311206400</td><td>\"An \"\"Energy Drink\"\" that doesn't overdo it\"</td><td>\"I don't know if it's technically an energy drink or not (contains caffeine), but it works.

Further, I found I was getting queasy after drinking those teas.  It seemed I would have to forego my afternoon cup of tea.

Their whole lineup is great and highly recommended if you have a puppy/dog with a sensitive tummy.  FYI My pup is currently 5 months old and is a 8lb Shihpoo.

I do not like my milk to get sweet while I'm eating a cereal & with this the milk got really sweet right away. I wouldn't drink the milk if my life depended on it.

We brought back 5 brands of this stuff in our suitcases from grocery stores on that trip.  I think Walkers Wood was one of the brands.  In any case Walkers Wood is great and is now on the menu in the households of my 4 adult children. We use it at least once a week on our gas or charcoal grill year around.<br /><br />My Chicken 'Recipe'<br />Use a whole cutup chicken or equivelent package of chicken wings or chicken drummies . . . or for best value get a 10 pound bag of frozen chicken wings from Costco. $2.00/pound compard to $3.25 at grocery store.  Coat with about 2 heaping tablespoons of this sauce. If you have the time, let it marinade for a while.  Put on indirect heat on the grill for 1 hour+ for a whole cut-up chicken or 50 minutes for wings.  Turn over once during cooking.  Adjust the time for the temperature.  The built-in thermometer on my Weber gas grill runs at about 375-400 degrees when it is turned to about 20%.<br /><br />Dark Golden Brown . . . The Jerk Sauce darkens more than just plain chicken.  Indirect grill until deep golden brown.<br /><br />Slow grilling can chemically burn off the 'heat' in peppers. Depending on the audience, we sometimes add a little Tobasco Sauce to the Jerk Sauce to reinforce the pepper.  Some of the best Jerk Chicken & Pork vendors in Kingston serve jerk that is HOT! . . but nothing a couple of Red Stripe beers or coka-colas for kids can't fix.<br /><br />Other Vendors in Negril and Ocho Rios tame the heat but still have the spicy and lime flavors.<br /><br />If you want to complete the Jamaica experience serve with Fried Rice and Peas.  Prepare some white rice, add some chicken bouillon and 1 finely diced Serrano pepper, then finish in a fying pan with a little oil and green peas.</td></tr><tr><td>125124</td><td>B000NY8OLK</td><td>A3M6TZW7CM50UE</td><td>Ryan</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1306454400</td><td>\"Avoid the \"\"new recipe\"\" at all costs!\"</td><td>\"I have to agree with the majority here.

After supplementing their regular canned food with small amounts of the Quail & Chicken over a period of about two weeks (six cans divided between two cats) in order to introduce it gradually, the cats began refusing to eat it all together. It smells like roasted poultry and they ate it readily at first. I feel it must not have agreed with their tummies, or they would have continued to eat it. But who knows why these things happen with fussy cats. I tried to reintroduce it several times over the next few weeks, but they'd have none of it.<br /><br />I haven't tried lots of different natural canned foods for my cats, but I have found two that they consistently like. Those are Natural Life Lamaderm Lamb & Rice Platter and Natural Balance Indoor Cat Formula. But who knows why they prefer those, or how long that preference will last.<br /><br />UPDATE (July 17, 2011): I've recently learned about an ingredient in Merrick's canned cat foods that may have caused my cats to reject it, after having eaten it readily at first. That ingredient is \"\"yeast extract.\"\" It seems that this is just an innocent-sounding name for glutamates (the same as in monosodium glutamate or MSG).

It helps me to relax and when I've had bad acid reflux it has helped to calm my stomach. Sometimes I like to mix it with the Tension Tamer tea and put a bag of each together in a mug. Or use it with a bag of the Chamomile tea. It also makes a nice relaxing tea when you mix all three together and drink it hot or cold. I've used it to sleep but it also helps to relive a tension head ache. It helps to reduce tension from stress so that you can relax. It has also helped to reduce my lower back pain and neck pain. I've also drank it just because I like it.

I thought I got a good deal and save a trip to Korean town.  Guess not, I am wrong.  I am going to the Korean town this weekend to get the real stuff.  A little disappointed, I really want my authentic spicy red Korean Shin instant noodle tonight...<br /><br />This Shin noodle is made in the USA and it is a American version of the very popular Korean instant noodle.  This American version is only one-third as spicy and the noodle get soft and mushy very fast like the regular instant noodle.  The dry vegetable package does not go soft even after 10 minutes.  To use the dry vegs in the future, need to soak it for at least 30 minutes so the dry mushroom will get soft. The spice package is orange color, the real Korean Shin noodle is bright red in color and the noodle will not get mushy after 10 minutes.  I think it is something to do with the red pepper that the Korean use and not the picante in this USA version.  It is spicy but taste totally different than the Korean kind of red pepper which make it so special.<br /><br />Really want to return it but since I got it with the lightning deal discount, I will eat it like regular instant noodle to save the hazzle.  So beware if anyone reading this is Korean or have tried the real Korean Shin instant noodle.  This is not the real thing, do not order this and do not pay full price for this American version of the Shin noodle.

Some folks in the reviews almost acted as if these noodles were sent from God.  I've eaten Ramen Noodles for quite some time and have found them to be a super inexpensive meal at .10 a package and sometimes cheaper.  I also like other readers mentioned don't always use the entire seasoning packet because of the high sodium content.  I found these noodles to have even higher sodium content.  Which I guess isn't too bad if you don't plan on eating the soup.<br />These noodles to me tasted just about the same as Ramen Noodles except the noodles were a tid bit larger in size.  If we are reviewing just the flavor packet, I would say it was pretty good.  Especially for those who like spice like myself.  I am use to eating super spicy foods and have a high tolerance to spice.  So they were right on par with what I am use to as far as the heat goes.  But I can see someone who doesn't eat spicy foods to find the seasoning super hot and spicy for them.  I like the idea of the dehydrated veggies that are enclosed to accompany the seasoning.  I am giving these noodles 3 stars because they are just overpriced Ramen in my opinion.  Plus the sodium content in the noodles is just unacceptable.  They surely can come up with lower sodium options. And lastly I give it 3 stars because of the price.  I would not expect to pay more than .50 cents a package for these noodles in a retail store.

The possibilities are endless when it comes to adding ingredients to this ramyun, but even if there is nothing added, it is still very good. I really like the packet of freeze dried vegetables that come with it. I have half a box left and I already know that I will be ordering more if I can't find something similiar in the grocery stores in my area.<br /><br />To address the sodium issue - yes, there is about half your days worth of sodium in one flavoring packet, BUT you most likely won't be able to handle the heat of one whole packet so you won't be consuming the full amount of contained sodium and if you do use the entire packet, just watch your sodium intake the rest of the day and double your water intake (you will probably do that anyway to cool your mouth from the heat, but it's a good burn :)). These aren't incredibly healthy. My boyfriend and I usually split one because there is a lot of noodles per package and it is so filling. You do not want to eat this for several days in a row, but a lot of things are okay in moderation. I whole heartedly believe that one package of these noodles is a heck of a lot healthier than anything offered at a fast food chain.</td></tr><tr><td>100086</td><td>B000LQORDE</td><td>A2Q7K7XKKLCBPT</td><td>Kyle</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1323216000</td><td>So Hot but So Good!</td><td>Great on a really cold day and if you're really congested.<br />The spiciness of the ramen really clears my sinuses when I have a cold.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this for those who only like mild-medium spiciness.<br />This is a very spicy ramen, and will really make your lips tingle and tongue burn.<br /><br />If you can handle it spicy, this is the best ramen.</td></tr><tr><td>100087</td><td>B000LQORDE</td><td>A12LTYDEZDUEIV</td><td>Neutralist</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1327881600</td><td>tasty, but loaded with sodium and better prices locally</td><td>\"This is probably the #1 Ramen in Korea which I also enjoy, but you should be aware of the nutrition facts.<br /><br />The nutrition table on the bag is for 1/2 a serving, which equates to 1/2 a bag.

Once I learned the nutritional facts, I use the full bag of noodles with half packet of the soup base.  The other method would be to cook the whole bag as usual, but immediately throw away 1/2 the soup to avoid the temptation of eating the whole thing.<br /><br />Lastly, my secret to best ramen is no secret to Koreans - after the noodle is dropped in boiling water for 1 minute, drop an egg and sliced spring onions and cook for 1 more minute.

Some other gross flavors include pencil shavings, skunk smell, rotten eggs (the worst in my opinion) & toothpaste. GREAT party game for kids, my 10 year old & friends loved it.

I haven't found any other ramen that I like as much as this.<br /><br />Most ramen I eat as drained noodles sprinkled with the seasoning packet, but this one is much better as a soup.  The seasoning is far too spicy to eat these noodles dry, but the seasoning packet is perfect for seasoning soup.  Other types of ramen don't make the kind of flavorful soup that this one makes, but there is enough flavor in one packet of this stuff to flavor a LOT of water!<br /><br />A word of warning... this soup is VERY spicy.  I regularly eat hot wings, spicy potato chips, and I put extra hot sauce in spicy chili.  I like spicy food.  But this stuff is pretty harsh.  If you're very sensitive to spicy foods, I would avoid this one.  If you're mildly sensitive to spicy foods, just use a little extra water in the soup.  I wouldn't say this stuff is over-the-top spicy, but it has a pretty strong kick.<br /><br />I think the thing I like most about this type of ramen is how flavorful the noodles themselves are, even when they are made as a soup.  When I make ramen as a soup with other types, the noodles are almost flavorless.  But these noodles really soak up the flavoring very well.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that I don't care for the vegetables that come in the vegetable packet.  Fortunately, they are separate, so I just don't put them in.  I find that they don't get soft enough, and I don't like the texture or flavor of the vegetables.</td></tr><tr><td>100092</td><td>B000LQORDE</td><td>A33YZNZIRA3H97</td><td>l2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1306540800</td><td>thick chewey noodles</td><td>\"The big problem with most instant noodles is that the thin noodles get soggy and mushy when sitting in a bowl of soup, then loose quickly their flavor.

Just be careful if you are on a diet, since one package if 500 calories (the \"\"per serving\"\" label is for less than half a package).<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because instant noodles have so much fat and salt.

I had fond memories of rice and noodle concoctions from my student days and I was drawn to these because of the many excellent reviews.  Indeed, after reading some, I fully expected my toes to tingle after eating these!  :)<br /><br />At first I really liked them, and yes, they are truly spicy.  I like spicy.  The spicier the better.  Besides, the reviewers are right- you can just put in as much of the spice packet as you want.  After a few of them, though, it occurred to me that the spicy wasn't like any Thai or Cambodian food I've had, or even straight up hot chilies like habaneros; the spice struck me as more chemical-induced.  Was it the MSG?  The other salts?  Whatever it is, it doesn't settle well with these taste buds.<br /><br />The more I ate, the less good they seemed to me.  After a while, I noticed that they always left kind of a gummy, coated feeling to the inside of my mouth.  Then I looked at the ingredients.... Maybe it is all the MSG, or maybe the beef tallow, or maybe all the sodium variants that I can't even pronounce.  Whatever it is, these are losing their appeal with every serving.  Now, I'm not a health foodie and despite the fact that one package doses you with 88% of daily value of sodium and 40% daily value of fat, I'm not holding that against it.  (to be fair, the previous amounts assume that you use the entire spice packet and each package counts as 2 servings)  It really comes down to that gummy feeling left in my mouth after eating a package, even using 1/3 of the spice packet.  I just can't get past that.<br /><br />The noodles seem like any other ramen noodles, and they are yummy.  It's also nice that they have a decent size packet of dehydrated veggies inside, separate from the spices.<br /><br />Taste is totally about preference, and I don't think this is a bad product just because it didn't work for me.  Also, I think they are priced right, especially if bought through subscribe and save.  I've got to go with my experience on the rating, though.  Though I won't be getting these again, I wouldn't steer people away.  I would suggest, though, first looking at the ingredients list to see if you are cool with what's in it, and also get a few to try before committing to a bulk buy.</td></tr><tr><td>100095</td><td>B000LQORDE</td><td>A3JPE8YTGJPF40</td><td>\"J.

Those who don't like spicy food should not purchase them, however.

It is on the spicy side however in my opinion it is not over the top spicy.  Has just enough heat to be noticable and if you drink the broth you will get the full effect of the heat. These packets also make a slightly larger portion than your standard Top Ramen and Maruchan ramens. I nomrally make this with egg whites from two eggs.

They are a bit salty, and spicy, but that's not always a bad thing and sometimes really hits the mark.  They are easy to make, have good instructions on the package, and are of excellent quality.  I think they are definitely worth the price, which is higher than many similar products, and can easily be doctored up a level with the addition of some onion, chive, or egg.<br /><br />Also, and not a small matter, they are made in USA, which I think means less concerns about food safety and labeling accuracy.<br /><br />Upside - taste, quality<br /><br />Downside - prepackaged ramen is generally not the healthiest thing you can eat, and this product is no exception - it has 44% of the daily allowance of sodium, and 8 grams of fat, mostly palm oil.

Definitely a more hearty texture to the noodles and the spice has got some serious kick! For those who don't like spicy, I would recommend starting with maybe 1/2 of the pack of seasoning & working your way up, but for me, the whole packet is perfect!

The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00.The only fault I could find, in my opinion, is that the product has lamb.  I won't eat lamb and have never before bought any dog food with lamb or veal in it. I do not like the way the animals are treated and lambs are sweet, baby cuddly things. It makes me sad.  Unfortunately, this company uses lamb in most everything for some reason.  I have never seen this before in a dog food  product. They might have one or two items with lamb, but not most all. They do have the chicken and rice without lamb.

It will stand up nicely to a shot of your favorite flavor, and even shines through getting mixed with cocoa and vanilla for a toasty mocha.<br /><br />I just wish the coffees I'm finding out that I really, really like weren't shooting up into the \"\"Can't Afford\"\" ranges.

Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber.

When I saw this multi-grain variety of penne I was eager to try it. Now I'm eager to get the gluey, sodden mess it created out of my house.<br /><br />The texture is a total disaster: it breaks apart before the pasta is even to al dente stage. The result is a melange of crumbling broken bits of half-cooked product that has the texture and (presumed) flavor of wet fiber-board.

I ended up getting a pack of these Easy-Mac to-go cups since I loved easy-mac as a kid. They worked out pretty well!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Easy - very simple instructions, no additional stuff needed (except about a cup of water). Following the instructions on the pack yields the exact advertised product<br />2) Quick - 3.5 minutes in the microwave!<br />3) Similar to stove-top Easy Mac - taste is very similar to the stove-top version. Though consistency is not (see below).<br />4) ample cheese sauce - my gripe with Easy Mac is that sometimes it lacks in the cheesiness (compared to other quick-type macaroni and cheeses such as velveta). This comes with a pretty good size pack of cheese mix, and definitely carries through in execution.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) noodles are a bit mushy - This is obviously not fresh, homemade pasta,  and the noodles are a little mushy after cooking in a microwave on high power. Doesn't particularly bother me though, but if you're a pasta snob (cough, Scott Conant, cough), you may wanna steer clear.<br />2) Takes a while for sauce to thicken - The instructions require that you add the cheese sauce mix after you microwave the pasta alone. Then you stir for a while until the cheese sauce thickens to your liking. It will take a while. In my experience, expect to face an additional 5-7 minutes of stirring the hot pasta with sauce before it thickens to the traditional consistency of Easy Mac (ie. macaroni and cheese).<br />3) Small portion - I'll admit, this is probably an item that is targeted for children, but in any case, it's a fairly small portion. More of a snack than a meal. Then again, I don't think I'd really like an entire meal of Easy Mac...<br /><br />Overall, it's a small pack that's easy to throw in my bag on days I don't have access to a fridge to keep my lunch cold. It's quick, easy, and requires no additional items to make (again, aside from water). If ever I need this kind of item again, I will definitely purchase!</td></tr><tr><td>100403</td><td>B0029K38GC</td><td>A1FO7PK3HZ1JTS</td><td>Nicola</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>1350432000</td><td>Easy to make but...</td><td>It's super easy to pop this in the microwave and it's done in 3 minutes but the noodles turn to mush.

I was introduced to it four years ago, through a local celiac support group.  It is a cup-for-cup replacement for all-purpose flour in your own favorite recipes.  You can even use it to make a roux.  In some recipes, I find it best to add a tad more flour or a tad more liquid -- but I can tell whether I need more of either as I am mixing the ingredients.  And, with some recipes, I do need to increase the baking time as gluten-free flours do tend to take longer to bake.  I use it for cakes, cookies, muffins, bread and breading for fried foods, pie crusts and other pastries, gravies and roux, waffles, whatever.  I have noticed that foods fried with Domata Living Flour do not absorb as much oil as foods fried with all-purpose wheat flour, so they are crisper and they reheat well without turning soggy.  I don't need extra gluten for pie crusts, but you can add a tad more xanthan gum if you find that it is not quite stretchy enough for your pastry recipes.  The taste and texture are equal to all-purpose wheat flour.  Baked goods may not rise quite as much as with a wheat flour, but I find that the cakes and muffins are still the same size as they were when I made them with all-purpose wheat flour.  I have shared this with many celiacs or those who cook for celiacs, and it has been a hit with each and every one.  One note:  if you are using an old bread recipe, remember that gluten-free dough has no gluten to be developed by kneading and does not benefit from the second rise that some recipes include.  You can do either without harm, but there is no advantage to doing so.<br />This is the one gluten-free flour I must have in my kitchen.</td></tr><tr><td>100445</td><td>B003QTB222</td><td>A16IVOG5UZ2EN2</td><td>Mrs L</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>1341360000</td><td>\"Life Is \"\"Normal\"\" again...\"</td><td>Thanks to Domata Living Flour I LOVE cooking and preparing foods once again.

Hershey's Special Dark with Almonds is not as intense, but it is smoother, not as sweet as the milk chocolate--which I don't prefer--and it contains a satisfying amount of almonds that aren't chopped up into tiny pieces.  When I don't splurge on something more intense and expensive, this is always my second pick unless somebody has another brand that's more concentrated on sale.  As it is, HSDWA is more amenable to breaking down in your mouth because it's a bit creamier than your usual darks, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's just rich enough to win over all those milk chocolate fans who are hesitant about going too severely dark, and it's not repellently sweet like a Cadbury can often be.  Just like Coke Classic, it's hard to beat a Hershey bar in price and quality, so if you find the gourmet bars a bit too harsh and pricey, this may be the way to go.  As for me, I'm easy, and that just makes me a chocolate 'ho'(Yes, I've said that before!), and variety is the spice of life.  Make sure they're fresh, though, because sometimes you get the chalky ones, and that can be a turnoff.  LOL, I'm not picky.

To frame how I feel about this Green Mountain Colombian K-Cup I feel it might be best to share how I go about making a cup of Dunkin' coffee when I'm at home.<br /><br />I use a coffee scoop to measure out my coffee.  To my tastes, the perfect home brew is 7 mounded scoops and 7 cups of water.  I put all this in my Cuisinart 1200 and come out w/ 6 cups of java bliss.  I use sugar and milk in my coffee; when I make my coffee as stated it get a satisfying mocha swirl of coffee and milk.  Just by sight I can tell my cup is rich.<br /><br />Now, using that as my baseline, I find this K-cup to be very satisfying.  I have tried MANY kinds of regular coffee K-cups, and this is the first one that makes a satisfying cup of full bodied coffee to my tastes.  Granted, I brew on the 6oz setting.  If you take your coffee black maybe you can get away w/ the 8oz setting.  The cup reminds me of my beloved Dunkin' (note I said reminds, its clearly not Dunkin' but I don't mean that in a bad way).  It doesn't end sharp or bitter like the very popular Coffee People Donut Shop.  It has a muted finish, reasonably full body for a K-Cup, and nice flavor.  When I pour in the milk, I can take more than a drop before turning the cup white - which tells me the cup is rich.<br /><br />Its my go to cup when I'm not brewing a pot.<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I highly recommend it if you like your drip coffee as I describe above.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, it doesn't taste like the Dunkin' I brew from a drip machine, that's why !

Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again.

Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.

My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you!

Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past.</td></tr><tr><td>100543</td><td>B0007A0APS</td><td>A4WDWH96JRMY7</td><td>S.

Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews.

He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.

We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.

We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.

Add to this the fact that 90% of all sugar is now genetically modified and the label does not say it isnt...<br />We like the taste of this so if taste and the absense of hydrogenated oils is your only concern, this is a good choice.

They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.

We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs.</td></tr><tr><td>100752</td><td>B008EOE3KM</td><td>A3IOW0VXK3LN8B</td><td>cabinlady</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>1350777600</td><td>Sweet morning treat</td><td>I love my Sweet Raspberry coffee in the morning.

These deficiencies can cause irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure. So what if it contains electrolytes.

He is 3 1/2 and healthy (or at least he WAS until recently).  He has routine physicals including bloodwork for kidney problems so I didn't worry when I read that this food can cause problems with underlying kidney disease.  One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought, no big deal dogs get tummy upsets once in awhile, right?  But he didnt get better.  His Belly and hind legs started to swell so much that the skin looked like it would tear...  multiple labs and fecals showed kidney disease of unknown cause.  He has had ultrasounds, multiple blood and urine cultures, a plasma transfusion and is now on multiple medications.  His BUN/CREAT has shot up and he now refuses to eat ANYTHING.  His entire diet consists of water, pills and whatever vitamin paste I can force him to take.  My heart is breaking for him...  I can't do anything and feel helpless.  If it goes on much longer without improving I will face the horrible decision of humane euthanization.  I feel that it was caused 100% from the high protein diet.  We can find NO other cause and he has no underlying kidney disease.  Please choose a different food and save the pain that my dog and I are going through right now.<br />UPDATE>>> Not long after I made this review Ollie lost his battle to acute renal failure at the young age of 3.  No other underlying condition was found and my vet feels that the extremely high protein content in EVO is what shut his kidneys down.

Evo has the highest meat content in any dog food I've seen.  My dog loves the small bites.  It is very high in protein, so I do not recommend this to people who have little dogs unless they are very active.  I have a 8mo old Belgian Malinois and her breed needs good quality food as she is a working dog.  She did have diarreah in the beginning, but I think its because I switched it from red meat to chicken too fast.  So, if you are planning to switch to Evo, just make sure you take at least 10 days to fully switch it to Evo.  I am serious, I never wait that long, but with this high of protein, you really need to transition this food slowly.  Otherwise, your dog will have a rumbling tummy and possibly poopy accidents in your house.<br /><br />The wet food is amazing too.  It contains quality ingredients and even smells decent.  I wish more people would buy better quality food for their pets.  Its such a shame to see dogs eating Kibbles and Bits or Pedigree or basically anything you buy from Walmart or Target.

Iams and, Eukanuba in particular, were a cut above other mass market dog food brands, and were only available through specialty pet stores and veterinary clinics. (Note, one can't compare their original foods with the quality of our present products, as premium all natural dog food, as we know it today, did not exist in the 1990s).<br /><br />Shortly after the acquisition, P&G expanded both Iams and Eukanuba to the mass market, making it widely available in supermarkets and retail stores such as Costco, K-Mart and Walmart, across the globe.<br /><br />Within months of the takeover, it became very apparent that changes had been made to the formulation of the foods. There were numerous accounts of dogs and cats suddenly developing various health issues and dog food allergies -- from diarrhea to intense itching, brittle and poor quality coats, skin rashes, hot spots, and even blown coats.<br /><br />The packaging remained unchanged, and no notification was given to retailers, pet owners or vets. (Note: Pet food companies are not required to list ingredient changes on dog food labels for 6 months -- a legal loophole for P&G).<br /><br />After much publicity and a huge public backlash, P&G admitted to switching ingredients from rice to barley, but denied making any other formula changes.

But since I started doing Atkins, I was buying them sometimes to fill that desire for a crunchy, salty snack.  I ended up only buying the hot variety since it seemed to cover the taste of the rinds better than plain or bbq.  After reading the reviews here, decided to give these a try.<br /><br />I had never had anything other than the bagged variety of pork rinds.  As others have mentioned here, these are far superior to anything you will find in a bag.  Way, way better than any bagged variety I have sampled.  Plus the make this great popping, crackling noise when you take them out for a minute or so that I greatly enjoy for some reason.<br /><br />Do mind the cooking instructions.  If you overcook, they will end up tasting closer to the bagged taste you are trying to avoid.  Still better than bagged though.  I tried different times in my microwave but found it best to watch and take them out as soon as the bag stops rising.

They are high in sodium, but that's nothing new for a soup. Just be careful with the rest of the daily menu so it all balances out.  The red chili and the green chili soup mixes are perfect with a cup or two of chopped broccoli thrown in.  I tried broccoli in the tortilla soup but it wasn't a good mix. I may try adding chopped squash or some other veggie instead.<br /><br />My package was leaking powder when it arrived. Several of the packets were not sealed properly and had leaked out.

My nutritionist recommended a protein supplement, along with regular exercise if I wanted to keep my muscles healthy. The 40 grams of protein in this drink is a major kick for muscle health and at only 260 calories, I can have two per day, and reduce my other meal portions to balance the total calories.

It's appropriate for low-carb diets. But after getting a case four months ago, the last two are still in my refrigerator, and I just can't bring myself to choke them down. They're just too cloyingly sweet for my taste. It's possible that my low carb regimen has made me just too sensitive to sweet taste, but I still use Adkins shakes and don't cringe when I go to consume one.<br /><br />Also, the Adkins shakes are about the same cost per ounce, but are smaller. These are pretty big (17 oz), so you better be ready for a big shake. Even when I started, I routinely threw away the last two or three ounces, so that's another mark against them compared to Adkins, which have a portion size more in my range.<br /><br />I think these work better for someone who's more on a body building regimen than a weight loss one. I do some of both, but my primarly focus has been on high protein, low carb for weight management. These didn't do the trick for me in that area. They're not terrible, but I won't get getting any more.</td></tr><tr><td>100928</td><td>B0034L4YGI</td><td>A3E1IB4CGSA9IF</td><td>Ironandivory</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>1332892800</td><td>Good but not great</td><td>The product is good for on the go cold or room temp but I'm amazed how much sodium is in there! 600mg!

But the aftertaste has a kind of bite to it that's hard to describe.  I suspect I'll get used to it and keep ordering this flavor for variety.

So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-2nd steep (3.5) - On the second steep the flavors and scents finally come through and produce a more respectable cup however still on the weaker side for me.  It should be noted the 2nd steep will stand up to a longer steeping time. Tried a 3rd steep and it was too weak.<br /><br />Summary- I paid more for this than on Amazon by ordering a holiday tea collection direct from Bigelow (the single box on here was to much and I wanted variety. I love Halloween and as such pumpkin things tend to suck me in, for the price it is on here I would not discourage purchase however just know there is better out there. If you are looking for something to get you in the mood for fall, this will do. I will happily finish the box, but unless it is clearance at a store I do not plan to purchase more.<br /><br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp) \"\"steep\"\" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference.

It's optional, but when I brew, I like to add just a touch of chai tea flavoring (I use the Torani syrup).  Once ready, I add a sweetener packet and top it off with a little milk.

Although this won't replace my favorite black teas, I found it a very welcome addition to my cabinet as a flavorful treat.</td></tr><tr><td>100983</td><td>B000Z4SWII</td><td>A105CCKIWRGI3X</td><td>\"Ian Hunt \"\"wakkoss\"\"\"</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>1260835200</td><td>Excellent tea</td><td>My girlfriend loves this tea and it's hard to find in the stores, especially when it's not the Thanksgiving/Christmas season, so I was thrilled that Amazon had it.

One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.

Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.

We are glad we did.<br /><br />This coffee smells so good when it is brewing so we knew that was a good sign when we made it later that night after we got home shopping. Then we tried it and basically fell in love with it and don't drink anything else now in the mornings. We do have an iced coffee that is different on the weekend but that's another review.<br /><br />I highly recomend this coffee to anyone who like us feels that the bold and medium roasts are just too strong.

The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.

It took a few pieces to get used to the taste and texture since it's really not quite like any other snack I've had.  The pieces are very thin and light like a tortilla chip, but they're also textured and grainy like a cracker.<br /><br />After the first 4 or 5 chips I decided I did like the taste and texture and easily munched down the rest of the bag.  The bag is a small 1 oz of 140 calories and seems to have as many chips as one of those 100-Calorie packs.

First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href=\"\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ\"\">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href=\"\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18\"\">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers</td></tr><tr><td>203952</td><td>B001QEEXCK</td><td>A28MG088LYIKHB</td><td>Puppy love</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>1303948800</td><td>Wrong bag pictured</td><td>Just an FYI to other customers: This item is for the Beef and Ocean Fish formula which is in a RED bag.

The chocolate does have a bit of that 'healthy' flavor that's familiar in meal replacement/drink mix products. There is a bit of real chocolate taste to it and the texture is satisfying. The bar has a chewy and slightly crunchy consistency. I love that it requires a bit of chewing and has a good enough flavor to enjoy it.<br />I wouldn't consider this a 'snack' though. At 230 calories a bar, it's probably a meal for any one watching their weight, or like me, trying to lose weight. These go great with a hot cup of coffee in the morning or a cold glass of water for lunch.<br />I do feel full for 2-3 hours after eating one of these, sometimes longer.<br />I was a bit disappointed that this 'No Sugar' product had 25 carbs. There is 20 grams of protein to help even it out but only 2 grams of fiber. It'd be nice if these had some extra fiber to them or simply less 'sugar substitute'. I would say as a rough average there's about 17 net carbs per bar. Not bad but I was expecting less, I suppose many people subtract all the sugar alcohols from the total carbs however, maltitol is awfully close to sugar, so I don't feel that would be accurate.<br /><br />I enjoy the flavor of these and will probably keep them in rotation since they do have a nice price compared to other meal bars.<br />I hope ThinkThin expands their flavors, I would love to see what they could do with tropical flavors. Like coconut. (Their lemon one is on my must try list.)<br />Definitely a product I can recommend, for those who like chocolate.<br /><br />--Mine came with an expiration date 11 months away and seemed fresh.

When he was young I fed him Beneful and he did okay for a bit and then he would have medical issues.  Through expensive medical treatment, we would get him back to normal but it was only a short time before the next outbreak.  I tried everything.  Supplement pills, different foods, allergy medication, steroids, limited diet and nothing seemed to work.  He would get better and then back to being bad with him constantly itching, chewing his skin, and he just looked miserable.  It seemed as though this cycle would never end.<br /><br />Then while visiting my brother who owns a collie recommended this food because I kept commenting on how healthy he looked and how soft his fur was.  I was hesitant at first because I had tried so much and nothing had seemed to work.  I gave the Wellness Super5mix whitefish and sweet potato a chance.  All I can say is that he no longer has ANY skin irritations, his fur is shinny and soft, he has a lot more energy, and overall I would say he is in his best health every.  The change came after about 3 weeks of him eating the food.  We use to have to bath him once a week and with the Wellness food we bath him maybe once a month.<br /><br />But I will say this food will not have the same effect for every dog.  As some of the others on here have stated that their dog had loose stool issues and the dogs simply refusing eating the food, this is very true.  My other dog has no allergies what so ever and I figured if it worked for the one dog it should be fine for the other so I would only have to buy one type of food.  The non-allergic dog began eating the Wellness and had immediate issues with loose stool and upset stomach.  So I keep him on his old food which is just the average food you would find in any pet store.<br /><br />Give it a shot if you have exhausted all other efforts.  All I can say is that my dog is in his best health ever and it was only due to a better diet and more attention and with the help of Wellness.  I would recommend this food to anyone who shares similar dog problems as I have experienced.</td></tr><tr><td>165543</td><td>B001QE7J2G</td><td>A2YJXRMQLRY81F</td><td>potomac_ginger</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1348704000</td><td>Great food - huge price increase...</td><td>This is a great grain free, alternate protein dog food.

Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable. Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it. Thankfully, however, that isn't the case. While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether. The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter). It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book.

They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.</td></tr><tr><td>382184</td><td>B009M2LPHO</td><td>A151SVTDXG25AP</td><td>Sam</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1331078400</td><td>DISGUSTING!</td><td>\"OK, let me start out by saying I'm extremely biased when it comes to sodas.

The consistency is not too soft and not too hard.  So, I decided to try the Albanese Gummi Rings in Peach for a change.  The consistency is quite gummi and not like a fruit slice, but the flavor just was not what I expected.  They are a tad bit softer than a gummi bear.  I expected a fresh taste like a juicy peach right off the tree.  There is definitely a peach taste, but not a fresh real peach taste.  It is not horrible and I enjoyed them to some extent.  Two gummies at a time were enough, any more and it was too much.  I suppose calorie wise, that is a good thing.<br /><br />I'm going to give these four stars as I do like them, but probably would not buy them again.  I can see other people enjoying these more than me.  I think really that it is a consistency thing.  To compare this to other types of gummi rings, I would say these are definitely better.  If you are a gummi ring lover, I would say that you would enjoy this candy.  The price is phenomenal.  You get two bags of 4.5 pounds each for a total of nine pounds!  That's a lot of candy.  I always have candy out in pretty clear containers at my home so that my friends will feel comfortable taking what they want.  My guests really enjoyed these rings and my stash went very quickly.<br /><br />The gummy rings were shipped in perfect condition and there was no melting and I am in Florida.  They were a bit warm, but they quickly come to room temperature and are perfect.<br /><br />These would be cute for wedding treats and a candy bar too. This is a candy everyone can enjoy, young and old!</td></tr><tr><td>286731</td><td>B00166D8P6</td><td>A3117DCR4GPSHR</td><td>ggs mom</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1276128000</td><td>good stuff</td><td>first let me say that i have not purchased this from amazon only my local gym it is cheaper on here so i will be buying it from here soon as far as the product my trainer introduced it to me and my friend, since we was trying to lose weight and build lean muscle, i have used it roughly 2 months and love it i drink it every morning and it curbs my appetite i can go till 1:00 or later before i start felling hungry where before i was hungry from the moment i woke till i went to bed, i also drink my shake after my workouts in the evening 3 times a week. as far as the taste if you just mix with water for me it is a little hard to swallow, i blend up frozen blueberry's and strawberry's which i thaw and add 2/3 cup water mix with powder in a shaker pretty good stuff you can also leave berries frozen to make shake thicker and more like a milk shake if you add powder to blender to mix it will be a little foamy that's why i mix it in a shaker if you decide to buy it try different ways till you find the way you like to drink it!</td></tr><tr><td>427809</td><td>B008FHUFAU</td><td>A329XXHMNK8QH8</td><td>\"Paul E Clay \"\"Paul\"\"\"</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>1213228800</td><td>Superb</td><td>This is just a great well rounded bold coffee that will be on my short list for the future.</td></tr><tr><td>76906</td><td>B0045TVL6E</td><td>A1ZZ1K3WCQ66X3</td><td>Portland</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>1324598400</td><td>yuk</td><td>tastes great at first.. then the after taste starts...yyuuukk.

They're a good (healthier) alternative to the stuff you can typically find in most retail stores.  They cost more by weight, but they're not really expensive either.  (If you try some and like them, stock up in bulk on Amazon because they're eligible for the free shipping, too!)  And they actually do last a long time - each pound box is a big supply because the treats are small, and my puppy doesn't care that they're small, he just loves eating them.<br /><br />I started using Zuke's Mini Naturals treats when my English Setter puppy was right around 7-8 weeks old when we started training simple obedience, then a few weeks later I ordered the Zuke's Mini Bakes as well.  As far as training goes, I agree with the reviewers who said that it is better to use a small moist treat for early training, as the dog can swallow it quickly and not take extra time to chew it up.  If the puppy is small in size or young, use a moist treat.<br /><br />For a larger puppy that's a little older, these mini bakes work fine for training.  My dog is now 5 months old and ~40 lbs. but he's still a puppy, and he can eat these quickly enough that they are a good training reward.  I still break them in half to make them smaller and make the box last longer.  They're scored across the middle so they break in half pretty easily.<br /><br />We've tried both the Turkey n' Taterz flavor and the Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz flavor.  He loves both.  He was a little hesitant to eat the biscuit the first time I offered it.  He sniffed, dropped it on the floor, and sniffed some more before eating it... after tasting it, he gobbled them readily, and continues to enjoy them.<br /><br />If you're wondering just how big these are... \"\"mini\"\" is correct.

Save the environment. ( I hate it whenever I throw out used K-Cups in such a good condition, one-time use) 2. Save money. ( Although K-Cups cost much less than a visit to Starbucks, it costs ~$0.43-$0.50  per Cup and it adds up.) 3. I get to choose to brew from any coffee of my choice. ( I can brew from beans purchased in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and etc.). Best of all, brew it right after I grind the beans. Fresh)<br /><br />After My-Kaps arrived, I can't wait to use it to brew the next day.<br />3 reasons that I love them:<br />  1. Thanks to the clear instructions sent with My-Kap, it's easy to get started, assemble and dissemble.<br />  2. The coffee brewed from reused K-Cups with My-Kap tastes great to the essence of your grinds, unlike bad reviews I've read for similar product. Even better,  I can change the strength of my coffee by adding less or more onto my reused K-cup.<br />  3. It does leak but not too much or too messy. I do not know exactly the reason or ways to prevent it from happening. I am still playing with it. But the leaks are not messy because they still go into the cup. I just have to remember to wipe the machine after brewing.  I do that as a routine regardless it leaks anyway, do it doesn't bother me.<br /><br />For the quality of the brewed I get, the money and wastes I saved, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommended to anyone who shares my desires to save environment, save $$ and has a freedom to brew different coffee each day. Not just different, but FRESH!!

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about \"\"bowel tolerance\"\" or \"\"happy bowels\"\" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

We are gluten free by choice. I made this cake to try at accommodating some family members that are gluten free.<br /><br />As a cake baker, this cake is mediocre. The texture of the batter is gritty (what do you expect when it uses only rice flour?!), but may be because I didn't throw it all in as the instructions said. I was worried that throwing in a stick of butter and eggs with the water and mix would yield a weird texture itself. However, it baked well. I found that it cracked on top though and it is so dense and heavy. This is not a light cake by any means, and if you're trying to make a layered cake, you have to be careful as it will crack easily and really feels like it will just crumble in your hands if you're handling it. The taste is just ok. It has an ok texture and decent moistness, but the moistness borderlines an undercooked taste, in my opinion. When you cut it, it falls apart and pulls if you aren't just cutting straight down. Mine definitely doesn't look like the picture on the box!<br /><br />I would say that if you have to be gluten free and have no other option, this might be a good quick cake for you. I think there are other choices that may taste and act more like a 'real' cake if you find the recipe. There are multiple gluten free blogs that have yummy looking and sounding cake recipes (which I intend to test). Why not a coconut flour cake? Or a combination flour cake? Rice flour alone is not my first choice.</td></tr><tr><td>459610</td><td>B0078EZHZE</td><td>A1GCOURMTPXKWI</td><td>Virginia L.

The shy one won't go near it. the first day with this, I filled it up almost full with kibble so it dispensed more easily, but she still got frustrated trying to figure out how to use it. After a couple of days, she can empty 1/2 cup of kibble from the small one in an hour :) and will continue to play with it as long as it has food in it.... the larger the treat size, the harder it is to come out. A couple kibble falls out every minute or so; a treat the size of a Zuke's Mini Bakes will come out every 5 to 10 minutes. I put 1/2 cup kibble and 10 mini bakes inside to keep her occupied for an hour. Note: the more full the jug is, the faster the dispensing rate (good for unmotivated dogs). The smaller the jug, the more full it is when a given amount of food is placed in it, thus if my pug had a hard time with the small size, I would buy the x-small so she could get the food out more easily. After a week of using it, I realize the small size is just fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />dog loves it<br />durable<br />keeps them occupied for unlimited time<br />i like the \"\"difficulty\"\" level of this toy: it is not too easy that it's emptied in 15 minutes like a treat ball</td></tr><tr><td>355522</td><td>B002QWP8H0</td><td>A31H9N00DB65HO</td><td>S.

Our dog Champ has a hearty appetite so we just knew he would love this, but it took him awhile to actually like it because he would only eat a little and then walk away but eventually he would return to finish eating. The next time I fed it to him I opened up a can of his other dog food and spruced it up just a little for him. My experiment of mixing in one of his favorite canned food and I put most of the canned food in the middle and on the bottom of his bowl and this got him a little bit more excited about Purina Beneful. I think that Beneful will take maybe a few tries before your dog will start to really enjoy it but I think that the ingredients are healthy enough for Champ and I want him to receive all of the benefits that Purina Beneful has to offer.<br /><br />He does appear to be a little more lively than usual and I want to attribute that to the change in his diet, but I'm not entirely sure. I love that my dog is happy and has an extra spring in his step, so I'll keep feeding him this until he isn't interested anymore or if there is a negative change in behavior. I like this food for my dog,but it needs a little more oomph to get dogs immediately excited.</td></tr><tr><td>222817</td><td>B005HGAV88</td><td>A1MIF84YZKY5NK</td><td>W. R.

At about 3 weeks, he became very fussy and we suspected colic as he would cry for hours.  At about 4 weeks, he had a horrible day--he cried the WHOLE day.  We tried everything but nothing could completely calm him.  The next day, he pooped a very hard poop...and was finally calm.  So the poor guy had been constipated.  We went out and got some prune juice--gave him 1 teaspoon in every other bottle.  And then we decided to switch formulas....<br /><br />Thank goodness we did!  We wanted to stay organic, if we could, so we tried Earth's Best Organic.  It was great--less gassy, burps smelled better (as did the formula itself)--and, most importantly, his poops are normal again!  It did take about 1 week for him to get back to normal (during this time, we kept doing the prune juice & Earth's Best)--his little system sure was messed up!<br /><br />So we highly recommend Earth's Best Organic, esp if you want to go organic and you want an un-constipated baby!</td></tr><tr><td>387720</td><td>B000FKL0D6</td><td>A31KCEEYGT1849</td><td>C.

Most non-Cantonese Chinese rarely consume it and certainly do not cook it.  Char-Siu is ever slightly crunchy outside and is moist and tender inside.  The sauce is sweet and tangy with a touch of saltiness to it.  It is different from the American Southern barbecue which is slow smoked for hours, nor it is like the Coastal barbecue which is grilled on direct flames for minutes.  It sits in between.  The cook time is about 1-2 hours.  The cooking temperature also sit in between the Southern and Coastal barbecue.  You can eat it by itself.  You can eat it as part of a meal.  Of course, it is THE essential ingredient of the infamous Char-Siu Bao (Chinese BBQ pork buns).  When you eat a real good Char Siu, you just want to run home and kiss your mom.<br /><br />I am born and raised in Hong Kong.  I have tasted countless authentic Char-Siu for decades.  I know how to make my own Char-Siu sauce from scratch, but it takes time.  I still encourage people to at least make their sauce once, just to appreciate the ingredients.  There is no absolute recipe for Char-Siu sauce, but it must contains sugar, vinegar, honey, salt and soy paste.  Some people make their Char-Siu sauce from Hosin sauce since they share many ingredients.<br /><br />This Lee Kum Kee Char Siu Sauce is authentic -- not because I say so, but because its existence proves its authenticity.  Lee Kum Kee is a very famous Hong Kong brand which dedicates in making sauces.

Manager Special at less than a buck a box.<br /><br />Like most of the RONI packed mixes, it's quick, tasty and filling. You add water, butter and milk to the mix and in less than 15 MICROWAVE minutes you can eat. Just that 27% of your daily sodium limit is in each serving, when your monitoring that stuff.<br /><br />NOTE: The individual packages have a sell by date of May, 2010. We'll use up the 12 packs by then, but I'm leery of expiration dates that are close in.<br /><br />*** Microwave Recipe Variations without milk:<br />1.0 Cook pasta according to directions. Mix spice packet WITHOUT the milk and you have a tasty side dish without the dairy calories.<br /><br />1.5 Add 2 cups of chicken broth (2 buillon cubes + 2 cups of water) to the above variation. HEAT on HIGH for 4 minutes covered and you have a tasty soup.<br /><br />2.0 One Dish Meal...CHICKEN BREAST WITH PASTA-RONI ROBUSTO<br />Using round microwave dish mix 1 TBLSP olive oil, 2 TBLSP water, 1 tsp Italian Spice and a pinch of crushed Red Pepper Flakes. Then coat 2 skinless chicken breasts with mixture. Next cook covered on HIGH for 3 minutes. Follow usual Pasta Roni directions by adding the water and pasta to the chicken, until pasta is done. ADD the PastaRoni spice packet and toss . Then add 1 14oz can of Chunky Tomatoes and cook covered on HIGH for 3 minutes.<br />  My Son really liked it... suggested I slice the chicken breasts and make it a casserole.

My children, 7 and 9 years old, love this pasta. We use it in all of our pasta dishes; we even used it to make stir-fry Asian noodles and it worked very well. We have also tried bionaturae penne and fusilli, but did not like those products as much (we think it was due to the thicker pasta shape). I prefer the flavor of this pasta even to semolina pasta.

But honestly, I can barely taste it.  I have to liberally apply it and still it isn't even close to as yummy as I had expected.  For example, for putting on Broccoli, it doesn't come close to beating shaking on Parmesan Cheese.  Comparing it to Cheddar flavored popcorn from Popcornopolis, it isn't even close.  With popcorn, the problem is perhaps getting it to stick, so try spray butter or something to give it something to stick to.  So maybe with level expectations, it can still be good.  It certainly isn't bad.  But I've let it sit in my cupboard for a long time without using it now.  It was a let down for me.<br /><br />One nice thing is that it seems more natural cheese flavor than some other cheese flavoring shakers, such as Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning.  The alternative probably is because others might add salt, so they have more flavor, but taste more artificial.  So this does seem the more pure cheese route.</td></tr><tr><td>460695</td><td>B000MVIGSK</td><td>A3UWBZ8Q25AZUZ</td><td>D. A.

I was just making whole wheat pancakes from scratch until I found these, and I never went back to home made.  If you are used to Bisquick and that's what you like then these might be a change for you, but for me I couldn't tell these were 100% whole grain.  We camp quite a bit and I loved that I finally found a 100% whole grain pancake mix that was good, low in sugar, and most of all that all I had to do was add water, even better is that it is a 1 to 1 ratio on the mix to water so you don't need measuring cups while camping.  There are some good recipes I use this mix in, one was the apple spice cake which I now can no longer find one Kodiak Cake's website, maybe they'll repost it.  I tried their blueberry muffin recipe, not bad for a 100% whole grain muffin lower in sugar and fat, my daughters loved them, so...  We eat these quite often for breakfast and I don't feel bad that the girls eat them, they have a lot of fiber and except for a little bit of honey in them are a whole food.

Frank</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>1234224000</td><td>Reading the label makes ME hungry!</td><td>So, I have an older indoor cat who has confined herself, more or less, to my bedroom, since our son was born a few years ago.  While in hiding, she put on a few pounds.  I got to thinking about this and the economy over the winter, and realized that it was better all around, to keep her healthy than to have an ailing senior kitty.  I did some research on what a quality cat food should be and came up with some qualifications and went shopping.  I returned with another brand- reasonably priced and fitting requirements.  My cat liked it alright.  And she lost some weight- fast.<br />  It was serious weight loss and I considered rethinking my own diet, but then we found she had fleas!!!  Poor thing had the worst flea infestation ever (ditto my closet and bedroom)!!!!  Apparently this can happen, even after ten years indoors, if outdoor humans bring flea eggs in on their shoes!!!  I'm told indoor cats often prove the worst flea sufferers- I believe it.  There is no where for them to run or hide.  The flea population explodes fast.<br />  She  dehydrated, anemic and completely exhausted, and dying,  I thought.  She had taken to staying on my window sill and would not touch the ground for anything (where fleas live), but of cousre that would be limitedly safe, too.  Well, I made some trips to the VET and pet stores,  and along with my flea aresenal I purchased some new cats foods to encourage her to eat.  I wanted  something with beef and liver, hoping  to help her get past the anemia.  Beef is harder to find than one might think, but there were a few, including Blue Spa.  I thought it a little expensive, but not when my first baby is so sick!  I opened it  first.  My desparate cat lept off the sill and ran to the kitchen- no lie!  It was the first decent meal she had eaten in days.<br />  Blue Spa Selects start with meat- be it fish, poultry or beef- not meat by products or broth.  The next ingredient is usually chicken and maybe liver.  After that is is a medley of nice vegetables and fruits and stuff-like sweet potatoes, wild rice, cranberries broccoli and blueberries.  The there's all the required nutrients and minerals and such. Sounds like a good meal, now doesn't it?  I admit, I found this concept a little over the top a few year back when I first heard of it.  But, you know, I have had cats who ate vegetables when the opportunity arose (I also had one who LOVED a nice coffee cake before company arrived).  When my sick kitty showed so much enthusiasm for this product, I realized that she must get bored with her food, same as I would.  All the good and different tastes in these little cans could be a new lease on life.  She is still quite thin, but gaining energy, looks good, and loves her new food.<br />  My only complaint is that the beef & liver variety is hard to find (not on Amazon, either, it seems).  We have tried the other flavors, now and they are equally loved.  Also- there's no ginger that I've seen, - a commonly complained about ingredient of a similar brand.  Will be trying other products from this company, soon, once I get rid of my fleas, too.</td></tr><tr><td>176361</td><td>B000FDDESM</td><td>A8RLEWFNKPEDW</td><td>\"V.

But, when I opened the first box, I found they had weevils...not a huge infestation but still...once weevils get a foothold, it's all over but the shouting.  I suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we don't have weevils up here in the north.  Usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south.  I found them in southern biscuit flour that I bought at one of the discount grocery stores.  I pop the product in the freezer to kill the weevils and their eggs and then sieve them out...gross, but you can't save money if you toss everything that doesn't meet your approval.  Anyway, can't sieve crackers but I'm still tossing them into the freezer for good measure.  Don't want them to spread to any of my other pantry items.

The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach.  Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds.  The  healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect.  Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds.  Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache.  Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag.

They have ruined my screen door with their fighting.  I thought I would set this up around the perimeter of the porch to keep them away from the back door and also give my cat some peace of mind.  What the description doesn't tell you is that the fence cannot work unless the animal has contact with the ground and the wire and that it won't conduct through concrete nor can it have any brush in contact with it.  Basically, it has to be on earthen ground with absolutely no plants or anything in its way.  This would have been good to know before buying since my porch is a concrete slab followed by about 2 feet of flower beds which then goes onto common grounds (townhome).  Total waste of time, didn't even begin to set it up since the only place I would have been able to do so would have been in the way of landscapers.  Had to order the product and read the directions to find this out so beware, if you plan to use this in any situation other than a completely clear yard.  Also, only one wire will be electrified and the animal has to be in contact with it and the ground in order to get a the shock so I imagine that a cat would automatically just jump over it.  I guess I'll never be able to test that theory.  Was very disappointed that I had to return it without even giving it a try.</td></tr><tr><td>398243</td><td>B0049OQJXA</td><td>A1CDJ3DAIP0X6E</td><td>taressa</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>1317600000</td><td>BEST GF bread I've had!</td><td>This is the best gluten free bread I have had.

That doesn't make a difference to me, since I was looking for flavor alone.  However, if you are looking for a colorful candy for Christmas, this isn't what you are looking for.  The biggest selling point to me was a tasty mint made with Xylitol.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

I may be a little harsh because Coconuts are near and dear to my heart, but I have to be honest and I think they could have done much better.  For those of you who love coconut milk, I would recommend buying young coconuts from your local Asian supermarket. You can open it up, drink fresh milk and even eat some fresh coconut meat.  Nothing beats that experience... the real deal. Plus, it's better for the environment... no plastic containers or trash to worry about.

To me, it has a fuller flavor than other instant coffee brands I've tried. But, since taste varies widely from person to person, it's subjective to the drinker. I prefer my coffee with creamer and sweetener. If I didn't use creamer, I think that it would be too bitter for my taste as opposed to regular ground/perked coffee. I began using instant coffee for a couple of reasons. First, I would either perk too much, or perk too little. It was just too difficult for me to predict how much or how little coffee I would want during the day. The second reason is, it's quick. We have a hot/cold water dispenser and it's super easy to fix myself a quick cup. The majority of my friends are non-coffee drinkers and prefer tea. So, when I visit them, it's easy to carry along a premeasured amount of instant coffee to enjoy while visiting. I still perk regular coffee every now and then (Folgers), as there is a distinct difference between intant and perked coffee. Strangely, since I have been drinking more instant than perked, I have found that I am slightly favoring the instant over perked. If you have never had instant coffee, or tried Folgers Instant coffee, I imagine you could request a free sample packet from the company first to see if you like it before making a big purchase.<br
